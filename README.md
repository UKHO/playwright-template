# Playwright Template

This project acts as a template and exemplar to using Playwright, Typescript and the Page Object Model design pattern to test a multipage application.

## Run tests

Run `npx playwright test` to run all tests, there's no need to start up a webserver as that's handled by the Playwright Test framework. See [the Playwright command line docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) for more info.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
